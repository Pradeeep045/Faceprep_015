                    India won the T20 World Cup 2024 after beating South Africa by seven runs in Barbados. India opted to bat first and, despite an early setback of 34/3, a counter-attacking partnership between Virat Kohli (76) and Axar Patel (47) helped restore their position. A 57-run stand between Kohli and Shivam Dube took India to 176/7 in their 20 overs. Keshav Maharaj and Anrich Nortje were the top bowlers for South Africa.

In their chase of 177 runs, South Africa was initially reduced to 12/2 but a 58-run partnership between Quinton de Kock

                    and Tristan Stubbs brought them back into the game. Heinrich Klaasen's half-century further threatened India's position, but Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah, and Hardik Pandya's bowling in the death overs secured India's victory, restricting South Africa to 169/8.
        
        Following the victory, Rohit Sharma announced his retirement from T20 internationals, expressing his elation and gratitude through an Instagram post. "This picture epitomizes how I'm feeling right now. So many words but can't find the right ones to express what yesterday meant to me but I will, and I will share them, but right now I'm basking in a dream come true for a billion of us," Sharma shared.
